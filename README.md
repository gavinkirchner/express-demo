# Express-Demo

This project is meant to be a demo for setting up a Node REST API with Express from scratch.

Ultimately, we'll use Postgres.

Unlinke [this repo](https://github.com/gavinkirchner/react-redux-demo-api), Express-demo was not created using the express generator, and was set up from scratch.

This repo works with vscode and is set up to get debugging working.
